## 🎓 Teaching Users

When explaining to non-technical users:

> "Just open the folder with your computer's name on it, then double-click the files in order. First time: click 1-INSTALL. Every other time: click 2-START. That's it!"

Simple as that! 🎉

## 📊 File Numbering System

The numbering makes it obvious what order to use files:
- **1-INSTALL** = Do this first (one time only)
- **2-START** = Do this every time after that

Future additions could use:
- **3-UPDATE** = Update the app
- **4-UNINSTALL** = Remove the app
- etc.
